# General Go Style

## Formatting and Files

- Every Go file must be formatable by `gofmt`; the workspace runs the Go formatter on save.
- Use `snake_case.go` filenames named after their responsibility, such as `root_shelf_service.go` and `root_shelf_controller_test.go`.
- Keep package names lowercase and singular unless an established plural convention exists; do not create a package for a single use. Each directory under `contracts/core/v1/types/<domain>/` is an independent Go package, but its package clause consistently uses `coretypes`; when a file imports multiple domains, use domain-prefixed aliases to avoid collisions.
- Let `gofmt` order imports and group them by responsibility with blank lines: standard library, third-party Go modules, `shared/` (excluding `lib`/`util`), `shared/lib`, `shared/util`, `contracts`, platform, and runtime-owned imports. Every project import must use an explicit, accurate package alias such as `dtos`, `schemas`, `exceptions`, `types`, `apitransport`, or `coreadapters`; do not rely on the implicit name derived from the final import-path segment.
- Expand every non-empty struct literal across multiple lines, with one field per line and a trailing comma. Do not put DTO, response, or even a one-field struct literal on one line. This also applies to struct literals in `return` statements and nested struct literals.

  ```go
  return &UpdateMyStationByIdResponse{
  	UpdatedAt: station.UpdatedAt,
  }, nil
  ```

## Method Call Arguments

- Keep method/function call arguments on one line only when there are few and they are simple. When a call has more than two arguments, nested expressions, distinct semantic groups, or enough horizontal content to obscure each argument's role, expand to one argument per line with a trailing comma.
- Repository calls are especially strict: normal domain arguments and `options.With...` arguments are separate semantic groups; two or more options always require multiple lines. Even one option should be multiline when the call already has multiple domain arguments.
- Do not compress multiple `options.With...` calls onto one line or omit clearly named options to preserve a one-line call. Put each option on its own line and keep the established semantic order: DB/transaction, permission, soft-delete, locking, then batch.

```go
station, permission, exception := s.stationRepository.CheckPermissionAndGetOneById(
	request.Body.StationId,
	request.ContextFields.UserId,
	nil,
	allowedPermissions,
	options.WithTransactionDB(tx),
	options.WithAllowedPermissions(allowedPermissions),
	options.WithOnlyDeleted(types.Ternary_Negative),
	options.WithLockingStrength(options.LockingStrengthUpdate),
)
```

## Naming and Types

- Use `PascalCase` for exported types/functions and `camelCase` for unexported identifiers. Follow the project's existing Go abbreviation style, such as `Id`, `Url`, and `Db`; do not mix spellings within one domain.
- Versioned transport DTOs use the complete `XxxRequestDto` and `XxxResponseDto` names; database write models use `XxxInput`; database tables use `schemas.Xxx`. `gatewaycontract.Request[Dto]` and `gatewaycontract.Response[Dto]` are the transport envelopes between Gateway and Core; the DTO is the operation data unit.
- Align new files, transport controllers, adapters, services, repositories, and scopes by domain, for example `station_*`.
- Create an interface only when the caller needs a replaceable implementation, a boundary already exists, or tests genuinely require it. New interfaces follow the existing `XxxInterface` convention; do not pre-abstract a single struct.

## Service DTO and Repository Input Boundaries

- `XxxInput` under `internal/<service>/data/.../inputs` is a repository persistence contract: it describes data for create, update, partial-update, or bulk SQL and may only be used as repository input. Services, controllers, and Gateways must not use it as a transport request/response contract.
- When a service method has many parameters, represents one complete intent, or receives a Gateway request that must produce an external response, use `*XxxRequestDto` as the single request parameter and return `*XxxResponseDto`. Name variables `request` and `response`; do not introduce unclear `req` or `res` abbreviations.
- Service-only or Gateway-only workflows may also use concrete `XxxRequestDto`/`XxxResponseDto` types to group related data, context, and output instead of long parameter lists or anonymous structs. The name must describe the operation; do not use generic names such as `Data`, `Params`, or `Payload`.
- Keep direct parameters when there are few and their meaning is clear; do not force a DTO merely to apply a pattern. Create one only when parameter count, shared lifecycle, or a call boundary materially improves readability.
- A service is the conversion boundary between the two contracts: map the validated `request` to `inputs.CreateXxxInput`, `inputs.PartialUpdateXxxInput`, or a bulk input, then call the repository. Repositories must not import or depend on transport request/response types.

```go
func (s *StationService) UpdateMyStationById(
	ctx context.Context,
	request *UpdateMyStationByIdRequestDto,
) (*UpdateMyStationByIdResponseDto, *exceptions.Exception) {
	input := inputs.PartialUpdateStationInput{
		Values: inputs.UpdateStationInput{
			Name: request.Body.Values.Name,
		},
		SetNull: request.Body.SetNull,
	}

	station, exception := s.stationRepository.UpdateOneById(
		request.Body.StationId,
		request.ContextFields.UserId,
		input,
	)
	if exception != nil {
		return nil, exception
	}

	return &UpdateMyStationByIdResponseDto{
		UpdatedAt: station.UpdatedAt,
	}, nil
}
```

## Implementation Principles

- Follow the pattern of adjacent files in the same domain before writing a helper; reuse an existing repository, scope, option, validator, or exception instead of recreating it.
- Each function should work at one layer. Keep public HTTP parsing/validation and HTTP responses in the Gateway controller, workflows and transactions in services, and queries/permission SQL in repositories/scopes.
- Pass `context.Context` downward: HTTP services obtain it from `ctx.Request.Context()`, and DB sessions use `db.WithContext(ctx)`.
- Never swallow errors. Map expected business/infrastructure failures to `*exceptions.Exception` and preserve the cause with `WithOrigin(err)`.
- Prefer direct, readable code; do not use generics, reflection, global state, or a new dependency to solve a single feature.

## Batch Database Operations (Mandatory)

**Per-row database operations are strictly forbidden.** A `for` loop may only normalize input, build sets/maps, assemble batch inputs/placeholders, or construct a response; it must not perform any database operation, including:

- raw SQL：`Exec`、`Raw`、`Scan`。
- GORM queries/mutations: `Model`, `Create`, `Updates`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Find`, `First`, `Count`, `Pluck`, and so on.
- Repository methods, other service methods, or any helper that indirectly executes SQL.

This rule is not relaxed for small data sets. If a requirement appears to require per-row work, first change it to a batch interface, collection query, or set-based SQL operation; do not leave an N+1 implementation in the function. When database parameter or statement-size limits apply, split the work into fixed-size batches, but each batch must still be one set operation rather than one query per row.

Use the following order of preference:

1. For one read, use `IN ?`, joins, preloads, CTEs, or an existing bulk repository method, then match the data in memory with a map/set.
2. For batch inserts, use `CreateInBatches` or an existing `CreateMany`/bulk repository method.
3. For batch updates, upserts, or relation changes, assemble `valuePlaceholders` and `valueArgs` in a loop, then execute one `VALUES`/CTE statement; every value must be a bound parameter, never a user-data string interpolated into SQL.
4. When SQL must preserve input order or return per-row results, include an index in `VALUES`, then map one `RETURNING`/`Scan` result in memory.

```go
valuePlaceholders := make([]string, 0, len(bulkInputs))
valueArgs := make([]any, 0, len(bulkInputs)*2)
for _, input := range bulkInputs {
	valuePlaceholders = append(valuePlaceholders, "(?::uuid, ?::text)")
	valueArgs = append(valueArgs, input.Id, input.Name)
}

sql := fmt.Sprintf(`
	UPDATE "StationTable" AS station
	SET name = value.name
	FROM (VALUES %s) AS value(id, name)
	WHERE station.id = value.id::uuid
`, strings.Join(valuePlaceholders, ","))
result := tx.Exec(sql, valueArgs...)
```

Handle empty input first to avoid invalid `VALUES` statements. Handle the `Error`, `RowsAffected`, and transaction completion of a single bulk query according to the existing exception and transaction conventions.

## Shared Libraries

- Before adding a helper, check [shared/lib](../../shared/lib/) for a package that already provides the responsibility. Reuse an existing implementation instead of copying it into a service/repository.
- Choose the existing package for the problem: use `shared/lib/array` for deduplication/sets, `shared/lib/searchcursor` for cursor pagination, `shared/lib/concurrency` for concurrent work, and `shared/lib/queue`/`shared/lib/stack` for queues/stacks. Flatten EditableBlock trees with `shared/util/editableblock.FlattenEditableBlock(s)`; use `shared/util/responsewriter` and `shared/util/exceptionwriter` for cross-runtime HTTP response formatting and public exception rendering. Rate limiting remains owned by each Gateway runtime.
- `shared/lib` contains only cross-domain, reusable logic independent of the application layer. It must not import Notezy project code; required third-party libraries are allowed. Business rules used by one domain stay in that domain instead of moving to shared for possible future reuse.
- When an existing library is close but not an exact fit, add the smallest generic capability to that library. If the need belongs to one domain, use a small domain-local helper and avoid creating a one-off shared package.

## Change Scope

- A feature change modifies only the necessary layers and their tests; do not reformat unrelated files or perform broad renames as cleanup.
- Existing uncommitted user changes are outside the current scope unless explicitly requested or directly conflicting with the files being changed.
- New settings, environment variables, API fields, database columns, and event formats are contracts; update the corresponding documentation and consumers in the same change.
